# 1. Initial Architecture Decision

Date: 2025-01-26

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to build a system that can generate software architecture designs, produce code, and deploy to Azure. The system needs to be scalable, maintainable, and easy to extend.

## Decision

We have chosen to use:

- Python 3.9+ as the primary programming language
- FastAPI as the web framework
- Pydantic for data validation
- Azure for deployment

### Rationale

1. **Python 3.9+**
   - Excellent ecosystem for AI/ML integration
   - Strong type hints support
   - Wide adoption in the industry
   - Rich package ecosystem

2. **FastAPI**
   - Modern, fast (high-performance) web framework
   - Built-in OpenAPI documentation
   - Native async support
   - Type checking and data validation with Pydantic
   - Easy to scale and maintain

## Consequences

### Positive
- Rapid development capability
- Built-in API documentation
- Strong type safety
- High performance
- Easy integration with AI services

### Negative
- Team needs to be familiar with async Python
- Requires careful handling of async operations
- Need to manage dependencies carefully
